# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Any security vulnerabilities discovered must be reproducible in the most recent version of the `master` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities through a [security advisory on Github](https://github.com/LocalineServices/web-app/security/advisories/new). We make every effort to respond as soon as possible, although it may take a few days for us to determine the severity of the report and its impact.

Please, _do not_ use a public facing channel or GitHub issues to report sensitive security issues.
